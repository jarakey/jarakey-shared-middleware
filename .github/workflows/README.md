# Backend Service CI Workflow Template

## Overview

This directory contains CI workflow templates for backend services that use the shared migration package. The workflows are designed to properly test and build services that depend on `jarakey-shared-middleware`.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Copy the Template

Copy the `backend-ci-template.yml` file to your service's `.github/workflows/` directory:

```bash
cp jarakey-shared-middleware/.github/workflows/backend-ci-template.yml \
   your-service/.github/workflows/ci.yml
```

### 2. Customize for Your Service

Update the following variables in the workflow:

```yaml
env:
  SERVICE_NAME: 'your-service-name'  # Replace with actual service name
  APP_TYPE: 'backend'
  GO_VERSION: '1.23'  # Adjust if needed
  MIGRATION_PACKAGE: 'github.com/jarakey/jarakey-shared-middleware/migrations'
```

### 3. Ensure Proper Directory Structure

Your service should have this structure:

```
your-service/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ci.yml
├── cmd/
│   └── migrate/
│       └── main.go  # Uses shared migration package
├── go.mod           # References shared middleware
├── middleware/      # Uses shared middleware
└── handlers/        # Uses shared middleware
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### Shared Middleware Checkout

The workflow automatically checks out the shared middleware repository:

```yaml
- name: Checkout shared middleware
  run: |
    if [ ! -d "../jarakey-shared-middleware" ]; then
      git clone https://github.com/jarakey/jarakey-shared-middleware.git ../jarakey-shared-middleware
    fi
```

### Migration Package Testing

Tests that your service can properly use the shared migration package:

```yaml
- name: Test migration package integration
  run: |
    # Test migration tool compilation
    go build -o /tmp/migrate-tool ./cmd/migrate
    
    # Test middleware imports
    go test -v ./middleware/...
```

### Dependency Management

Ensures proper Go module management:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    go mod download
    go mod tidy
```

## 📋 Requirements

### Go Version
- **Minimum**: Go 1.23
- **Recommended**: Go 1.23 or later

### Dependencies
- `github.com/jarakey/jarakey-shared-middleware` in your `go.mod`
- Proper import paths in your Go files

### File Structure
- `cmd/migrate/main.go` - Migration tool entry point
- `middleware/` - Middleware implementations
- `handlers/` - HTTP handlers
- `go.mod` - Go module file

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### 1. Migration Package Integration
- ✅ Tests that migration tool can be built
- ✅ Tests that shared middleware can be imported
- ✅ Tests that dependencies resolve correctly

### 2. Unit Tests
- ✅ Runs all Go tests with race detection
- ✅ Generates coverage reports
- ✅ Enforces coverage thresholds

### 3. Linting
- ✅ `go vet` for basic Go issues
- ✅ `golangci-lint` for comprehensive linting
- ✅ Continues on linting failures (non-blocking)

### 4. Build Verification
- ✅ Tests that service can be built
- ✅ Tests that migration tool can be built
- ✅ Verifies all dependencies are resolved

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Issue: "Cannot find module"
**Solution**: Ensure your `go.mod` has the correct replace directive:
```go
replace github.com/jarakey/jarakey-shared-middleware => ../../jarakey-shared-middleware
```

### Issue: "Import not found"
**Solution**: Check that your import paths use the correct module name:
```go
import "github.com/jarakey/jarakey-shared-middleware/middleware"
```

### Issue: "Migration tool build failed"
**Solution**: Ensure your `cmd/migrate/main.go` imports the shared package:
```go
import "github.com/jarakey/jarakey-shared-middleware/migrations"
```

## 📊 Coverage Requirements

### Default Threshold: 80%
- Services must maintain 80% test coverage
- Coverage is calculated from `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out`
- Build fails if coverage is below threshold

### Coverage Calculation
```bash
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/%//'
```

## 🔄 Workflow Triggers

### Automatic Triggers
- **Push to main**: Runs full CI pipeline
- **Pull Request**: Runs tests and build verification

### Manual Triggers
- Can be manually triggered from GitHub Actions UI
- Useful for testing changes without commits

## 📁 Artifacts

### Test Results
- Coverage reports
- Test output logs
- Build artifacts

### Retention
- **Duration**: 7 days
- **Storage**: GitHub Actions artifacts storage
- **Access**: Available in workflow runs

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Keep Tests Fast
- Use table-driven tests
- Mock external dependencies
- Avoid slow I/O operations

### 2. Maintain Coverage
- Write tests for new features
- Update tests when changing logic
- Aim for 80%+ coverage

### 3. Use Shared Packages
- Import from `jarakey-shared-middleware`
- Don't duplicate functionality
- Follow established patterns

### 4. Handle Failures Gracefully
- Use `|| echo "Failed but continuing..."` for non-critical steps
- Provide clear error messages
- Don't fail the entire pipeline for minor issues

## 📚 Examples

### Complete Service Example
See `services/admin-service/.github/workflows/ci.yml` for a complete implementation.

### Migration Tool Example
```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "log"
    "time"
    
    "github.com/jarakey/jarakey-shared-middleware/migrations"
)

func main() {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Second)
    defer cancel()
    
    config := &migrations.Config{
        DatabaseURL:    os.Getenv("DATABASE_URL"),
        MigrationsPath: "infrastructure/scripts",
        Timeout:        30 * time.Second,
        LogLevel:       "info",
    }
    
    migrator, err := migrations.NewMigrator(config)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to create migrator: %v", err)
    }
    defer migrator.Close()
    
    if err := migrator.Up(ctx); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Migration failed: %v", err)
    }
}
```
